# Biography

Hi, I am a current Computer Engineering student at SIUE. I am from Columbia, Illinois and have worked on technology my entire life. I have been an incredibly hard worker since I was 14 and held my first job as a lawn mower for Sonnenberg's Landscaping and have worked many other jobs since then.

# My Projects

I have worked on many personal projects during my time at school as well as in my freetime. These include:

## Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URCA) with Dr. York

- This involved building a camera system that is small enough to improve on current technologies.
- Currently, this technology requires two incisions and is invasive. With this new system, it is possible to create a single incision for both the instruments and camera, as well as being able to pan with a spring system in order to see around the body.
- This project has its difficulties such as having to keep everything in such a small package.
- I have also learned the in's and out's of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) as this project requires being able to focus in on a certain object and possibly have the camera follow the object around with the spring assisted system.

## Voice Recognition/Voice Recreation Software

- This project is my most recent project that involves audio recognition and vocal recreation.
- This project can be found under the [Hackathon Project 2023](https://github.com/probstcj/Hackathon-Project-2023)
- This project was done under **48 hours** and was presented to judges
  - This ended up winning the most ambitious award.
- The features of this project include:
  - Fourier Transform analysis
  - No machine learning algorithms
  - Display of Fourier Transforms
  - English to Phoneme translation
